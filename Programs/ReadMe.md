These were my first Java projects.

BMI Calculator was made to help my weight loss journey during the pandemic.
Googling my BMI after every workout was stressful especially at times when I dont have access to the Wifi, so I created a program that solves that problem.

It would be nice if this can be further developed into a mobile appðŸ‘€

Guessing Game was made to enforce muscle memory
